<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## üìö Introduction

<b>[Disnode](http://disnode.hirzalla.ca/)</b> is a full-stack application that allows members to create or join existing servers, connecting with others that share similar interests.

The idea of Disnode came from my love for online communities and game servers. I spend a lot of my time gaming with my friends, and we use Discord to do that. With my newly obtained knowledge from studying hard during my Bootcamp, I decided it would be super cool to make my own version of Discord. This is where the idea of Disnode came from, Discord but on Node (HAH! get it? sorry I had to).

### ü§ù **Collaborators**:

Each member focused mainly on different parts for this project, while also familiarizing each other with the rest of the application for context (we made sure everyone implemented at least a couple functionalities from backend to frontend).

- Adam Hirzalla ([**@adamhirzalla**](https://github.com/adamhirzalla)) - _Back-end (server and API routes), DB Architecture (ERD/Schema/Queries + shaping data), Sockets (server + client), AWS-S3 (server + client) & Front-end (React Contexts/Reducers + refactors)_
- Hyunsu Kim ([**@EavanK**](https://github.com/EavanK)) - _Middleman for backend/frontend (wire-ups), Front-end (React States/components), User Authorization - JWT (server + client) & API_
- Jonathan Su ([**@hjonsu**](https://github.com/hjonsu)) - _Front-end (styling/design), MUI components & Wireframes_

> This app was created as part of our final project for Lighthouse Labs - Web Development Bootcamp. The goal was to create a full-stack application from start to finish in just two weeks.
